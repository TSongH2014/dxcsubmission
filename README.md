Please find current directory for Question 1(DocumentRetrieval.java) and Question 2(Yet to complete) submission.

To run Question 1:
- Please ensure all txt files are in the same directory;
- Run in command line, first compile the java file with (javac DocumentRetrieval.java);
- Once the class file being generated, then followed by running (java DocumentRetrieval).
- When above command runs successfully, corresponding dictionary .txt files will be generated, with respective contents in the dictionary .txt file.
- Fyi, I purposefully leave all my previous working solutions commented, so you can see my working progress, on how I eventually come to the final solution for Question 1.
